## What is React?

**React** is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for web applications. It was developed by Facebook and is now open-source.

### Key Features:

- **Component-Based**: UI is broken into reusable components.
- **Declarative**: Describe what the UI should look like, and React updates the DOM accordingly.
- **Virtual DOM**: Efficiently updates and renders only the components that change.
- **State Management**: Uses state and props to manage data flow.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data moves in a single direction, making it predictable.

### Why Use React?

- Reusable components make development faster.
- Improves performance with the Virtual DOM.
- Large community and ecosystem (Next.js, React Native, etc.).

### Getting Started

To create a new React app using Vite:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-app --template react
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```
